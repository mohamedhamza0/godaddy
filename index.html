				<h1 class="honeone">
					Why do I need a website for my business?
				</h1>
				<hr />
				<p class="poneone">
					Even small local businesses that only serve their hometown need a site. That's because the web is the first place people go when looking for a product or service. A website helps every business:
					Promote and sell their products and services
					Connect with new customers (and keep existing customers)
					Compete with bigger businesses
					Best of all, a website is much easier and more affordable than you might think. GoDaddy offers a complete selection of online tools for building websites, along with hosting, email and marketing options to grow their business on the web.

				<h1 class="honeone">
					Why do I need a professional email?
				</h1>
				<hr />
				<p class="poneone">
					There are a lot of reasons to switch from your free email to a domain-based email, but here are the top 3:
					Customers are much more likely to trust a professional address like lily@lilysbikes.com than lilysbikestexas84@notmail.com.
					Professional Email provides world-class security with industry-leading spam and virus filters.
					Personalized email addresses promote your business more effectively. Every time you send an email, you are giving your web address to customers and prospects, encouraging them to visit your website.
				</p>
				<hr />
				<h1 class="honeone">
					Why get a domain name from GoDaddy?
